# Encrypt_Decrypt Python GUI

This project is a Python GUI application that allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages. The encryption and decryption processes are password-protected, ensuring secure message handling. The GUI is platform-independent, making it suitable for use on various operating systems.

## Features

1. **Message Encryption:** The application provides a straightforward way to encrypt messages to enhance security and confidentiality.

2. **Message Decryption:** Decryption is only possible with the correct password, adding an extra layer of protection to the encrypted messages.

3. **Password Protection:** The encryption and decryption processes require a password, enhancing the security of sensitive information.

4. **Platform Independence:** The GUI is designed to work seamlessly across different operating systems, providing a consistent user experience.
